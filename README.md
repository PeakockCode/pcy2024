To outline the content, we first need to identify some key questions that the dashboard should answer:

- Who are the leading YouTubers by number of subscribers?
- Which channels have uploaded the most videos?
- Which channels have the most views?
- Which channels achieve the highest average views for each video?
- Which channels have the best views per subscriber ratio?

These are some initial questions we aim to answer to reach our goal.
